<P>I reviewed this gentleman in the Hepatology Clinic today.&nbsp; Unfortunately it seems like there has been little mixed communication from the Rheumatologist at the Royal Free Hospital and here and this gentleman has been discharged from both of them although he is continuing on Colchicine and Prednisolone at 15mg a day.&nbsp; He has run out of his medication and I have given him a 30 day supply and I&nbsp;would be grateful if you could continue this on for him but he needs urgent re-referral to Rheumatology here for ongoing review.&nbsp; I will also e-mail the Rheumatologists so that they know about things sooner but I would be grateful if you could agree that this letter would be a referral letter for the Rheumatologist.</P>

<P>From a liver point of view it is unclear whether he has simple steatohepatitis&nbsp;and this is likely to be non-alcoholic fatty liver disease although he does drink about two bottle of wine a week and I have&nbsp;urged him to cut down to one bottle a week.&nbsp; His weight is 74.9 and his height is 163 giving a BMI of _____.&nbsp; He has diabetes which I think is diet controlled which will also contribute to steatohepatitis.&nbsp; I have explained that the only way to discern between the two would be to have a liver biopsy and if his liver function tests is still abnormal I&nbsp;will get&nbsp;on and&nbsp;organise that prior to his next appointment.&nbsp; He is going away in a couple of weeks for a holiday.</P>

<P>I have therefore given him a repeat prescription of his Colchicine and Prednisolone&nbsp;today and repeated his blood test.&nbsp; I will coordinate with the Rheumatologist for urgent review.&nbsp; We will see him again in clinic in three months' time either before or after liver biopsy.</P></td></tr>

<p>I reviewed this gentleman in the Hepatology Clinic today.&nbsp; Unfortunately it seems like&nbsp;he has&nbsp;been discharged&nbsp;from both the Rheumatologists at the Royal Free Hospital and here, although he is continuing on Colchicine and Prednisolone at 15mg a day.&nbsp; He has run out of his medication and I have given him a 30 day supply and I&nbsp;would be grateful if you could continue this on for him but he needs urgent re-referral to Rheumatology for ongoing review.&nbsp; I will also e-mail the Rheumatologists so that they know about things sooner.</p>

<p>From a liver point of view it is unclear whether he has simple steatohepatitis&nbsp;that is likely to be non-alcoholic fatty liver disease although he does drink about two bottle of wine a week. I have&nbsp;urged him to cut down to one bottle a week.&nbsp; His weight is 74.9 and his height is 163 giving a BMI of 28.&nbsp; He has diabetes which I think is diet controlled which&nbsp;may also contribute to steatohepatitis.&nbsp; I have explained that the only way to discern between the two would be to have a liver biopsy and if his liver function tests&nbsp;are still abnormal I&nbsp;will get&nbsp;on and&nbsp;organise that prior to his next appointment.&nbsp; He is going away in a couple of weeks for a holiday.</p>

<p>I have therefore given him a repeat prescription of his Colchicine and Prednisolone&nbsp;today and repeated his blood test.&nbsp; I will coordinate with the Rheumatologist for urgent review.&nbsp; We will see him again in clinic in three months' time either before or after liver biopsy.</p>

<p>Addendum: ALT is a littel better at 69, ANA neg, Immunoglobulins normal. I thinks there is no ruch to biopsy given the normal fibroscan liver stiffness so we will review him in 3 months as palnned.</p></td></tr></table><BR><table  onmouseover="window.status = 'Transcription reference no.

<P>She lives alone in a ground floor flat and has bd carers who help her mainly with&nbsp;prompting of activities of daily living and with things like shopping.&nbsp; She is a&nbsp;lifelong smoker&nbsp;and drinks no alcohol and is reasonably physically robust and good on her feet.</P>

<P>On examination, she was well in herself with no peripheral signs of chronic disease, no lymphadenopathy and abdomen which was soft and non-tender but with some epigastric fullness and tenderness.</P>

<tr><td>originalcontent:</td><td><P>Thank you very kindly for referring ##TITLE## ##PATIENT_SURNAME## to our clinic.&nbsp; We saw ##TITLE## ##PATIENT_SURNAME## today for review investigation of post menopausal bleeding.&nbsp; She is a delightful 57 year old lady who has experienced a recent episode of vaginal bleeding which lasted for four days in the context of a year prior with no periods.&nbsp; Furthermore, 12 months ago she also had an episode of heavy bleeding and was unsure whether this was a period as she has had few periods in a year prior and thought perhaps that she was menopausal.&nbsp; She is currently on HRT patches and is unsure of how many years she has been on them.&nbsp; </P>

<P>Obstetrically speaking, she is a gravida 3, para&nbsp;1 with one previous normal vaginal delivery with no complications.&nbsp; She had menarche at the age of 11 and when she did have periods she menstruated regularly with a 28 day cycle.&nbsp; She suffered from menorrhagia in her 20s, and had an endometrial ablation when she was about 27 years old.&nbsp; She cannot recall exactly when her regular period ceased and thinks it was possibly around five years ago.&nbsp; She has previously used the oral contraceptive pill and IUD, but she has nothing in situ now.&nbsp; She has had a normal Pap smear less than two years ago.&nbsp; She continues on the HRT as you know.</P>

<P>Her past medical history is significant for hypothyroidism, and she states that her thyroid function tests six months ago were normal.&nbsp; She, however, now feels sluggish and feels that she may have become hypothyroid again.&nbsp; We have thus organised repeat thyroid function tests for her today.&nbsp; She has had a total knee replacement and ankle fixation, she suffers from hypertension, dyslipidaemia and gastroesophageal reflux disease.</P>

<P>Her current medications include Levothyroxine, _____<STRONG>(03:08)</STRONG>, Tramadol, Perindopril, Atorvastatin, Amlodipine and Bendroflumethiazide, Ibuprofen and HRT patches and Lansoprazole.</P>

<P>On examination today, she had a soft, non-tender abdomen with a bulky uterus palpable more so on the patient's left than on the right.&nbsp; Bimanual examination was difficult due to habitus, but the uterus was bulky, but mobile.&nbsp; On speculum, she had a multip os with no bleeding seen and a Pipelle was passed and sample sent.</P>

<P>She also had an ultrasound today that demonstrated a 156 x 86 x 128 large very bulky and globular anteverted uterus with heterogeneous patchy echogenicity consistent with adenomyosis.&nbsp; It was very difficult to assess the masses due to the heterogeneity of the uterus.&nbsp; The endometrium was difficult to identify for the Sonographer, but in all three potential images of the endometrium the thinnest was 10 mm which is thick for age.&nbsp; However, it might be thicker.&nbsp;&nbsp; No obvious masses were seen.</P>

<P>The case was discussed with one of our Clinical Nurse Specialists today, who agreed to follow up the Pipelle sample within the coming weeks.&nbsp; We have given ##TITLE## ##PATIENT_SURNAME## a follow-up appointment within two weeks.&nbsp; If the Pipelle sample were to prove inadequate, we will&nbsp;organise an outpatient hysteroscopy over the telephone over the next week.&nbsp; We have also sent ##TITLE## ##PATIENT_SURNAME## for thyroid function tests today.</P>

<P>Thank you very kindly for referring ##TITLE## ##PATIENT_SURNAME##.&nbsp; We will see&nbsp;her again in two weeks' time.&nbsp; We will keep you informed.</P>

<tr><td>originalcontent:</td><td><P>Thank you very kindly for referring ##TITLE## ##PATIENT_SURNAME## to our clinic.&nbsp; She is a 48 year old Farsi speaking woman who has presented for assessment and investigation of one episode of postmenopausal bleeding.&nbsp; She has experienced one episode of bleeding around a month ago which lasted one to two days and consisted of&nbsp;a brown coloured discharge four to five teaspoons in volume.&nbsp; She had some associated mild pain and a mild fever at the time.&nbsp; She is postmenopausal, and her last normal period was 18 months ago.</P>

<P>Obstetrically speaking, she is a gravida 4, para&nbsp;1 with one vaginal delivery, two early miscarriages and one 25 week&nbsp;pregnancy loss.&nbsp; She had menarche at age 12 and prior to the cessation of periods 18 months ago the periods were irregular.&nbsp; She has a normal Pap smear in January 2016, and also a known fibroid uterus.&nbsp; We had some difficulty with<STRONG> </STRONG>interpreting translating today, but ##TITLE## ##PATIENT_SURNAME## described what seems to be either an oophorectomy or cystectomy in 2002 on the right side where she says that she presented with some right iliac fossa pain and said that she thinks that the ovary may have torted.</P>

<P>Her past medical history is significant for depression for which she sees you, her General Practitioner.&nbsp; Her medications were not brought today, but consist of an antidepressant and I think something for her gastroesophageal reflux.&nbsp; She has no known allergies.</P>

<P>On examination today, her abdomen was soft, nontender and&nbsp;the&nbsp;fundus was not palpable.&nbsp; Bimanual exam was unremarkable and there was may be a possible small mass in the right iliac fossa.&nbsp; On speculum, we noted a bulky cervix which was displaced to the patient's left and could not pass the Pipelle as the cervical canal was at an angle.</P>

<P>We conducted an ultrasound&nbsp;in the pelvis today which showed an anteverted uterus containing multiple known fibroids with the largest one being a right pedunculated subserosal fibroid measuring 33 x 23 mm.&nbsp; The second largest was seen in the lower posterior wall measuring 18 x 15 mm.&nbsp; The endometrium was noted to be borderline thickened at 4.6 mm.&nbsp; The ovaries appeared normal.&nbsp; There was no free fluid or adnexal masses seen.</P>

<P>This case was discussed with Dr Taheri, the SpR, and we have thus booked the patient for an outpatient hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy.&nbsp; We note that she needs a Farsi translator for this.</P>
