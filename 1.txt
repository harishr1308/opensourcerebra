<P><STRONG>Comments in&nbsp;Management:</STRONG></P>
<P>##PATIENT_FIRSTNAME## is 23 months of age and was seen for the first time in clinic with both parents and younger sister.</P>

<P>Around 10 months of age, he ate a small amount of lightly boiled egg for the first time.&nbsp; He developed generalised urticaria and vomiting.&nbsp; For this, he was seen at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and given Piriton and an EpiPen.&nbsp; On further enquiry, he had had no systemic reactions apart from vomiting.</P>

<P>Subsequently, he has eaten baked egg products with no problem.</P>

<P>Approximately four days ago, he developed a rash which parents think may have followed from eating a certain food products that may have contained food colouring.&nbsp; However, the rash has persisted.</P>

<P>He is otherwise well and eats a generally normal diet.</P>

<P>He has no history of eczema or respiratory symptoms.&nbsp; His bowel habit is regular.</P>

<P>He was 34 weeks pre-term at Queen Charlotte's Hospital where he developed ?necrotising enterocolitis.&nbsp; He underwent a laparotomy at two weeks of age at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital but had no gut resection.</P>

<P>He is on no medication.&nbsp; </P>

<P>He has been immunised but not had MMR due to concerns about his egg allergy.</P>

<P>I note the mother has a history of&nbsp;hay fever, father is well.&nbsp; His&nbsp;nine month&nbsp;old sister&nbsp;has what sound to be transient gastro-oesophageal reflux.</P>

<P>On examination, he is&nbsp;very active and well.&nbsp; He has a papulovesicular&nbsp;eruption particularly on his limbs with relative central sparing.&nbsp; </P>

<P><STRONG>Plan:</STRONG></P>
<P>The history is very suggestive of egg allergy.&nbsp; For the time being, he should avoid raw egg but should continue to eat&nbsp;baked egg products&nbsp;and other food.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;arranged&nbsp;for skin prick testing to be performed when he&nbsp;has recovered from this.&nbsp; Following this, we will a make&nbsp;renewed allergy plan.</P></td></tr>
